--- TNS --- 

 Main observation: denseH as in [Fe2S2], pt2 is not sufficient unlike c2/cr2!
		   non-perturbative treatment / high-order PT?
		   more efficient capture of entanglement?

 20200405 bipartition analysis for arbitrary parition of rhos!
	  - permutation => sign
	  - bipartite entanglement analysis
	  - project rhos to local groups => optimized states!

 20200408 genetic ordering for minimizing entanglement?
	  - fielder ordering
	  - test for 2d hubbard model！
	  - relevance for quantum computing, which could 
	    reduce the depth of circuits in limited topology (e.g.,1D)

 20200409 grouping orbitals - meaningful structure & interpretation!!!
	  - Coarse-Graining? Hierachical Clustering??? 
	  - Can coarse-graining improve 2D-Hubbard Model description?
	  - Possibility to reduce entanglement?

 20200410 question: what types of configurations 
		    are relevant for S-T gap in Fe2S2???

--- Comb TNS ---

 20200417 Comb structure [topology/coord/support/sweep]

 20200420 SCI as initial guess? 
          - projection for obtaining schmidt basis {|r>}
	  - optimized implementation for Fe8S7 (eigen+svd)

 20200422 build local sites:
	  - A[n]=<ln|L> for MPS: become slow at the end, 
	    because the no. of underlying dets is large! 
	  - W[n]=<r1r2|r12> for Comb: type3 nodes
	  - check right canonical form by computing overlap Sr

 20200424 central wavefunction:
	  - implement wf for the last site from SCI wf
 	  - implement <n|comb> for checking

 20200427 refactorize the tns part to make them more modular
	  - essential for future developement
	  - separate into qsym, phys, qtensor[2,3,4]
	  - implement tensor contraction kernels for qtensor
	  - checked by evaluating <Comb|Comb> 

 20200508 initialize normal & complementary operators (MOST CHALLENGING PART)
	  - data structure for operators: qtensor2
	  - operators on dot (in memory)
	  - serializaiton: -lboost_system -lboost_filesystem
	  - implement recursive build of rops (blocking & renormalization)
	    - normal operators:
	      - a_pL^+
	      - a_pL^+a_qL (checked against fci_rdm1 for <psi1|p^+q|psi2>)
	      - a_pL^+a_qL^+
	    - complementary operators:
	      - lazy construction (to be improved in future - checked):
	        - Q_pLsL^R
	        - P_pLqL^R
	      - typeAB/typePQ decomposition (to be cheked by H1e & H2e):
	        - S_pL^R
	        - H^R
	  - check by evaluating energies
	  - note: currently the adjoint is used for operators like ap,
		  hence the renorm functions work only for <comb1|o|comb2>,
		  not for <combA|o|combB> where sites are different for A,B.
		  The impelementation of state-specific transition properties
		  requires more operators to be constructed in future.
		  Also, we do not use Hermicity of Bpq/Qps, which allows to 
		  compute <rdm1|p^+q|rdm2> for state-averaged comb states.

## Functionalities ##

* Selected CI:

  1. NR-SCI with entanglement measure

  2. Relativistic generalization SCI+PT: Au?	

  3. Open-shell KRCI: g-tensor?

  4. Core excitations? complex propogator? (A-w-i*gamma)x(w)=r

* DMRG:
  
  1. Det-Fit?
  
  2. KR-DMRG?

  3. Operator compression?

=============
 Note on SCI
=============

Selected ci fails in two forms:

   1. computational time increases when ci coefficients are dense!
   
   2. pt2 does not work well in providing good corrections (too small)

but it works when there is a few dominant configurations

Such situations appear in 

   a) geuine strongly correlated systems
   
   b) noninteracting molecules (while CC works) like stretched (H2)n

=========
 Targets
=========
 
   a) doublet benchmark sets: CO+, CN, N2+

   b) O2: SOC and ZSF testing ground!

   c) Selected CI: (A-w-i*gamma)x(w)=r ??? 
		   a=A+d 
      ===> How to do PT correction? <===
