 2020xxxx randomized SVD for generation of rcanon

 2020xxxx compile core/comb/ci into libx.a; linked with main in drivers
	  separate compilation for CTNS, enabling MPI parallelization
 
 2020xxxx large-scale applications: fe2s2/fe4s4/fe8s7/femoco?
	  - measuring Sdiag for different systems,
	    some of which are challenging for SCI+PT!
	  - see the review - The Spectroscopy of Nitrogenases
 	  - hyperfine/g-tensor [IMPORTANT!!! - appliable for quantum computation] 
		                <Psi|sigma K|Psi>? G-matrix;
		                How <Psi1|H|Psi2> are measured?
		                For VQE this can be made symmetric,
		                <0|(U1d*H*U2)|0> - Hardmard test]

--- Advanced functionalities ---

 2020xxxx implement 2-rdms: following DMRG implementation [Chan2008] 
 	  - restarted from fully converged one-dot comb state 

 2020xxxx operator compression or screening?
	  - scale up to D=5000-10000 may become advantagous! 
	  - using SVD format for operator block?

--- FUTURE ---

 2020xxxx entanglement localizaiton of SCI wavefunction? 
	  - orbital optimization <<< !!!
	  - 1-body & 2-body disentanglers? <<< !!!
 
 2020xxxx spectra and excited states: HCI/DMRG for RIXS 
  	  - Core excitations? complex propogator? (A-w-i*gamma)x(w)=r
	  - also relevant for quantum computation

 2020xxxx exploring more compact representation of many-body wavefunctions
	  - VMC-c-MPS ansatz?
	  - Neural network states?

=============
 Note on SCI
=============

 Selected CI fails in two forms:

   1. computational time increases when ci coefficients are dense!
   
   2. pt2 does not work well in providing good corrections (too small)

 but it works when there is a few dominant configurations

 Such situations appear in 

   a) geuine strongly correlated systems
   
   b) noninteracting molecules (while CC works) like stretched (H2)n

=========
 Targets
=========
 
   0) quantum supremacy: FeMoco?!!!

   a) doublet benchmark sets: CO+, CN, N2+

   b) O2: SOC and ZSF testing ground!

   c) IP of gold (Au): QED

 Problems

   1. thresh_proj & thresh_ortho sensitivity in SCI projection [theoretical/numerical problem?]
