# Matrix++: A set of program for many-electron problems #

## Functionalities ##

* Selected CI:

  1. NR-SCI with entanglement measure

  2. Relativistic generalization SCI+PT: Au?	

  3. Open-shell KRCI: g-tensor?

  4. Core excitations? complex propogator? (A-w-i*gamma)x(w)=r

* DMRG:
  
  1. Det-Fit?
  
  2. KR-DMRG?

  3. Operator compression?

=============
 Note on SCI
=============

Selected ci fails in two forms:

   1. computational time increases when ci coefficients are dense!
   
   2. pt2 does not work well in providing good corrections (too small)

but it works when there is a few dominant configurations

Such situations appear in 

   a) geuine strongly correlated systems
   
   b) noninteracting molecules (while CC works) like stretched (H2)n

=========
 Targets
=========
 
   a) doublet benchmark sets: CO+, CN, N2+

   b) O2: SOC and ZSF testing ground!

   c) Selected CI: (A-w-i*gamma)x(w)=r ??? 
		   a=A+d 
      ===> How to do PT correction? <===
