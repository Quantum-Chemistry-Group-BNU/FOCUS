 * Setup tests for NR & R integrals [DONE2021/03/24]
 
 * Redesign and decouple codes [DONE2021/04/08]
    
 * Implementation of CTNS with TRS [DONE2021/05/16]
    - checked for kinds {rN,rNSz,cN,cNSz,cNK}
    - rewrite qtensor such that qt2/qt3/qt4 are just views

 * Parallelization: MPI [DONE2021/05/30]
    - cleanup (IO) 
    - setup testing mechanism? 
    - preparation: makefile -> mpi 
    - mpi version 
       - distribute AP & BQ, compxwf, Hmat [DONE2021/05/23]
       - opt: HDiag, HVec, Davidson, pRDM, rwfuns, twodot [DONE2021/05/28] 
       - load balance: adjust distribution
       - careful check serial/parallel version against previous 
         versions with different compilers

 * Benchmark performances: Fe2S2 [DONE2021/08/11]
    - different topologies: -> SVD-based decimation
       - problem: TRS-adapted SVD decimation is necessary in initialization [DONE2021/07/06] 
       - problem: decimation in sweep -> have to give up perturbative noise for CTNS! 
		   - decimation_row_nkr [DONE2021/07/09]
		   - decimation_row_kr [DONE2021/07/11]

 * Optimized parallel version [DONE2021/10/02]
    - OpenMP support [DONE2021/09/03]
	- Hx & decimation
	- Initialization of CTNS
    - Z2 symmetry: {rZ2,cZ2}
        - Checked by diagonalizing fock::Hmat
    - better data structure for qtensor & oper_dict [DONE2021/10/02]
        - problem: can bypass the 2GB limit in MPI_COUNT using native MPI support (later)

 * Optimized Hx algorithm [DONE2022/01/XX]
    - onedot algorithm:
    	- generation of onedot_Hx formulae
    	- implemenation of onedot_Hx contraction [DONE2022/01/16]
	  - adjoint of Hterm is treated in symbolic_onedot_Hx
	- implementation of Kramers version of Hx [DONE2022/01/18]
	  - different treatment of Hl,Hcr,{CS/SC,AP,BQ}
    - twodot algorithm:
    	- generation of twodot_Hx formulae [DONE2022/01/18]
    	- optimized formation of sigma vector [DONE2022/01/22]
          - contract_qt4_qt2 (without intermediate/reshaping)
    - renormalization algorithm
	 - generation of formulae 
         - optimized renormalization [DONE2022/02/17]
    - profiling:
	- benchmark for small systems
	- minimize memory allocation / intermediates?
	- benchmark for [Fe4S4] systems
    - optimization:
	- avoid H() & K()
	- int1e only appears in oper_dot.h 

 * Large-scale parallelization: push to the limit!
    - GPU for contractions?

 * Applications:
    - Small system like C2+/O2? [checked against FCI results]
    - Fe2S2 [CAS(30e,20o)] - parallelized
    - SOC within this active space
    - G-tensor/GIAO for Ferric-Ferrous dimer [THIS WOULD BE GREAT!]
 
 * Twordms: enable Rel-CASSCF with interface to other codes

KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------

 1. thresh_proj & thresh_ortho sensitivity in SCI projection [theoretical/numerical problem?]

 2. to work with ctns, pRDM is removed which makes onedot opt prone to local minimum:
    implementing decimation for {|psi>, sum_k a_k|psi>, sum_l b_l|psi>} may help.
