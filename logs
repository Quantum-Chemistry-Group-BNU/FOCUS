	   - formulae correctly generated 
           - use input for schd & fname to control whether write *.txt 
    - optimization of onedot & twodot algorithm:

    - better data structure? pointer? [DONE2022/03/18]

    - concurrency: separate computation & save for saving oper_save [DONE2022/04/09]
    - remove hdf5 support: compare against iostream (timing)	
    - new computational model:

	2. compute [Hx/renorm] + save previous qops [threaded]
	3. fkept is updated, the old qops will be released
        4. delete unused file at a given bond
 ### NOT DONE YET ###
    - data compression? 
    - reduce half AB/PQ operators?

 * Distributed H[CS] term - Chan's algorithm [DONE2022/06/10]
    - renorm opS and opH
    - twodot partition
    - onedot partition
    - hdiag for ifdist1
   
 * Load balance:
    - better distribution of operators [DONE2022/06/15]
    - opS? currently this is not good because a*Ac type operators 
    - Hx? typical: cN [isym=1, ifkr=False]
		   cNSz [isym=2, ifkr=False]
		   cNK [isym=1, ifkr=True]

 * Restart from optimized states:
    - task_dmrg & lastdot
    - change the name of the file rcanon_new.info to avoid overwrite later
    - if the operator files are not deleted:
	 task_opt & rcanon_load & rcanon_file newname.info
      else rebuild the operators
	 task_dmrg & rcanon_load & rcanon_file newname.info

 * Better sweep performances [DONE@20220714]
    - Reducing the number of Hx in Davidson solver:
    	- tuning size of subspace & preconditioning
        - nbuff>=4 (larger value does not matter too much); keep 2 delU for restart!
	- LOBPCG like improvement 
    - Sweep decimation:
        - only perform decimation for 4*ksupp >= Dcut, hence boundary sites are 
          almost exact, unless some quantum numbers are missing from the start.
        - exact sites for cNK also work!
 
 * More abstract implementation: preparation for GPU
    - Basics [DONE2022/06/25]
       1. AXPY: form summed operators (form intermediates)
       2. GEMM: contract and accumulate
       3. MMlist & cost analysis
    - Twodot Hx [DONE2022/06/27]
    - Onedot Hx [DONE2022/06/27]

 ### TODOs ###

 * Openmp version: different parallelization strategies:
    - hvec4/hvec5/hvec6
    - Renormalization? [allows smaller temporary memory usuage!!!]
    - Kramers version?
    - Complex version: 'R'?

 * Towards large-scale parallelization [DONE2022/XX/XX]
    - profile openmp/mpi onedot/twodot version with large D
	- note: when noise is added, the results can be different 
	- analyze why the parallel efficiency is low?
	- 1. sort formulae + static/dynamic/guided,chunksize [DONE2022/03/05]
	- 2. private workspace?
	- 3. reduction
    - GPU implementation 
    - merged wf4[lc1,c2r] implementation?

 * Other improvements for special usages:
    - different symmetry, in particular, kramers version:
	- complex arithmetic
	- how to avoid repeated K()?
    - other topologies:
	- comb tns

 * Applications:
    - Small system like C2+/O2? [checked against FCI results]
    - Fe2S2 [CAS(30e,20o)] - parallelized
    - SOC within this active space
    - G-tensor/GIAO for Ferric-Ferrous dimer [THIS WOULD BE GREAT!]
    - entropy as a complexity measure?
    - classical help for quantum computing? better biased measurement?
 
 * Twordms: enable Rel-CASSCF with interface to other codes 

 * VMPS+GPU? (simply dense matrix multiplication?)

KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------

 1. thresh_proj & thresh_ortho sensitivity in SCI projection [theoretical/numerical problem?]
    => implement canonicalization with help!

 2. to work with ctns, pRDM is removed which makes onedot opt prone to local minimum:
    implementing decimation for {|psi>, sum_k a_k|psi>, sum_l b_l|psi>} may help.

     /home/lx/lzd/focus_repo/FOCUS/examples/3_h6+_kr
     finput= results/rinput.dat
     fname[ref]= results/rctns.out
     nsweep= 2
     fname[cal]= ./tmp/rctns.out
     nsweep= 2
     eref= [-2.89565156 -2.74390766]  ecal= [-2.89503561 -2.74089796]  ediff= 0.0030720814731275076
     fail

 3. In SVD-based decimation, it is possible that total=2, full=8, since some sectors do not have matched sectors.
   
     decimation for each symmetry sector:
     >br=0 qr=(4,0) rdim=2
     >br=1 qr=(5,-1) rdim=4
     >br=2 qr=(5,1) rdim=4
     >br=3 qr=(6,-2) rdim=2
     >br=4 qr=(6,0) rdim=8
      find matched qc =(0,0)
      SVD-based decimation: dim(l,r)=1,8
      sigs2[final]: 0.5 0.5
     >br=5 qr=(6,2) rdim=2
     >br=6 qr=(7,-1) rdim=4
     >br=7 qr=(7,1) rdim=4
     >br=8 qr=(8,0) rdim=2
     
     sorted renormalized states: total=2 dcut=2 thresh_sig2=1e-14
      i=0 qr=(6,0) 0-th sig2=0.5 accum=0.5
      i=1 qr=(6,0) 1-th sig2=0.5 accum=1
     select renormalized states per symmetry sector: nqr=9
      iqr=0 qr=(6,0) dim[full,kept]=8,2 wts=1 accum=1 deff=2
     decimation summary: 32->2 dwt=0 SvN=1
    
 4. The truncation thresh_sig2=1.e-14 may lead some differences on the number of renormalized states,
    such that the optimized energies can be slightly different with maxcycle truncated.
