### TODOs: more functionalities ###

 * Spin-adapted version? [DONE]

 * Reduced density matrix (RDMs) [!!!] 

 * Perturbative spin-orbit interaction?

 * Support Kramers version: 
   - support complex version [DONE@2023/02/28]
   - what about 'R' operation in contract? [general complex]
   - hvec4 error for CNSz in H5 with real integral? [noise cannot be added, 
      otherwise renormalized state become complex, and the construction of H 
      requires 'Conj' operation in GEMM!] 

### TODOs: better scalabilities ###

 * Better Davidson solver on GPU?
   - GPU memory is a problem

 * Real space parallelization (=> More GPU/DCU) [!!!]

 * Support Mixed CPU-GPU implementation?
   - mmtasks revise [also avoid copy for magma?]
 
 * Support further partition of operators: reduce GPU memory requirement
   - GPU only compute large blocks y[l,r,c1,c2] if d[l] & d[r] > dthresh,
     and hence we only need to send rows of o[l,:] and o[r,:] as well as
     the full vector x & y to GPU, which minimize the memory usage of GPU.
   - Can renorm be performed in a similar way?

### TODOs: applications ###

 * Towards large-scale parallelization: some old issues 
    - profile openmp/mpi onedot/twodot version with large D
	 - note: when noise is added, the results can be different 
	 - analyze why the parallel efficiency is low?
	 - 1. sort formulae + static/dynamic/guided,chunksize [DONE2022/03/05]
	 - 2. private workspace?
	 - 3. reduction
    - GPU implementation 
    - merged wf4[lc1,c2r] implementation?
	 - how to avoid repeated K()?

 * Applications:
    - Small system like C2+/O2? [checked against FCI results]
    - Fe2S2 [CAS(30e,20o)] - parallelized
    - SOC within this active space
    - G-tensor/GIAO for Ferric-Ferrous dimer [THIS WOULD BE GREAT!]
    - entropy as a complexity measure?
    - classical help for quantum computing? better biased measurement?
 
 * Twordms: enable Rel-CASSCF with interface to other codes 

 * VMPS+GPU? (simply dense matrix multiplication?)
