######################## THIS VERSION IS READY FOR RELEASE ########################


### TODOs: initial guess & p-DMRG ###

 * Convert UHF product state to FOCUS guess?
   - This may be operationally useful like BS-DFT.
   - femoco: 不同初始化策略，产生不同guess，然后筛选？

 * Perturbative noises: is it important?

 * p-DMRG: how to use dets in sampling? is it possible to avoid compression???
   - 设计概率p(Di), importance sampling
   - 避免压缩
   - 同时考虑能量分母
   - 用小体系n2测试?
   - combined with OO-DMRG?

 * 子博 => PT2 correction on top of NQS?
   - deterministic evaluation following Hanshi Hu's work
   - stochastic evaluation following Sandeep Sharma's work
   - more rigorous scheme akin to p-DMRG?

### TODOs: more functionalities ###

 * Kramers version for 2c/4c Hamiltonian: 
   - support complex version [DONE@2023/02/28]
   - what about 'R' operation in contract? [general complex]
   - hvec4 error for CNSz in H5 with real integral? [noise cannot be added, 
      otherwise renormalized state become complex, and the construction of H 
      requires 'Conj' operation in GEMM!] 
   - Two-RDMs: enable Rel-CASSCF with interface to other codes 

### TODOs: better performance ###

 * Faster Hxbatch algorithm:
   - implementation with minimal operation count?
   - eliminate common terms for subleading terms?
   - more balanced partition of {A,B} - global data structure to storage the distribution pattern?

 * Point group symmetry (D2h) -> good for molecules like cr2

 * Better Davidson solver on GPU?
   - GPU memory is a problem

 * Real space parallelization (=> More GPU/DCU) [!!!]
   - No really useful for pratical applications except for very large-scale benchmark?

 * Support Mixed CPU-GPU implementation?
   - mmtasks revise [also avoid copy for magma?]
 
 * Support further partition of operators: reduce GPU memory requirement [!!!]
   - GPU only compute large blocks y[l,r,c1,c2] if d[l] & d[r] > dthresh,
     and hence we only need to send rows of o[l,:] and o[r,:] as well as
     the full vector x & y to GPU, which minimize the memory usage of GPU.
   - Can renorm be performed in a similar way?

### TODOs: applications ###

 * Applications:
    - Small system like C2+/O2? [checked against FCI results]
    - Fe2S2 [CAS(30e,20o)] - parallelized
    - SOC within this active space
    - G-tensor/GIAO for Ferric-Ferrous dimer
    - entropy as a complexity measure?
    - classical help for quantum computing? better biased measurement?
