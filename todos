TODOs:

 1. Setup tests for NR & R [DONE20210324]
 
 2. Redesign and decouple codes [DONE20210408]
    
 3. Implementation of CTNS with TRS [DONE20210516]
    - checked for kinds {rN,rNSz,cN,cNSz,cNK}
    - rewrite qtensor such that qt2/qt3/qt4 are just views

 4. Parallelization [DONE20210530]
    1. cleanup (IO) 
    2. setup testing mechanism? 
    3. preparation: makefile -> mpi 
    4. mpi [DONE202105XX]
	- distribute AP & BQ, compxwf, Hmat [DONE20210523]
	- opt: HDiag, HVec, Davidson, pRDM, rwfuns, twodot [DONE20210528] 
 	- load balance: adjust distribution
 	- careful check serial/parallel version against previous 
          versions with different compilers

 5. Applications:
    1. Small system like C2+/O2? [checked against FCI results]
    2. Fe2S2 [CAS(30e,20o)] - parallelized
    3. SOC within this active space
    4. G-tensor/GIAO for Ferric-Ferrous dimer [GREAT!]
 
 6. Hybrid parallelizations: OpenMP & GPU?
 
 7. Twordms: CASSCF 

KNOWN PROBLEMs:

 1. thresh_proj & thresh_ortho sensitivity in SCI projection [theoretical/numerical problem?]
