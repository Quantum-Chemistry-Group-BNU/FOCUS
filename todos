TODOs

 * Setup tests for NR & R integrals [DONE20210324]
 
 * Redesign and decouple codes [DONE20210408]
    
 * Implementation of CTNS with TRS [DONE20210516]
    - checked for kinds {rN,rNSz,cN,cNSz,cNK}
    - rewrite qtensor such that qt2/qt3/qt4 are just views

 * Parallelization: MPI [DONE20210530]
    - cleanup (IO) 
    - setup testing mechanism? 
    - preparation: makefile -> mpi 
    - mpi version 
       - distribute AP & BQ, compxwf, Hmat [DONE20210523]
       - opt: HDiag, HVec, Davidson, pRDM, rwfuns, twodot [DONE20210528] 
       - load balance: adjust distribution
       - careful check serial/parallel version against previous 
         versions with different compilers

 * Benchmark performances: Fe2S2 [DONE20210811]
    - different topologies: -> SVD-based decimation
       - problem: TRS-adapted SVD decimation is necessary in initialization [DONE20210706] 
       - problem: decimation in sweep -> have to give up perturbative noise for CTNS! 
		   - decimation_row_nkr [DONE20210709]
		   - decimation_row_kr [DONE20210711]

 * Optimized parallel version [XXXX202109XX]
    - OpenMP support [DONE20210820] 
    - stack-like storage? 
    - parallelization - push to the limit!
       - monitor peak memory usage
       - problem: bypass the 2GB limit in MPI_COUNT?: -> Native MPI support [DONE2021XXXX]

FUTURE

 * Applications:
    - Small system like C2+/O2? [checked against FCI results]
    - Fe2S2 [CAS(30e,20o)] - parallelized
    - SOC within this active space
    - G-tensor/GIAO for Ferric-Ferrous dimer [THIS WOULD BE GREAT!]
 
 * Twordms: enable Rel-CASSCF with interface to other codes

KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------

 1. thresh_proj & thresh_ortho sensitivity in SCI projection [theoretical/numerical problem?]

 2. to work with ctns, pRDM is removed which will make onedot opt prone to local minimum:
    implementing decimation for {|psi>, sum_k a_k|psi>, sum_l b_l|psi>} may help.
