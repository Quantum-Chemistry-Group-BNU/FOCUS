 * Further optimized kernel for assembling RDM:
   - compare different options for alg_renorm and alg_rdm
   - profiling for FeMoCo with D>=8000
      - /public/home/bnulizdtest/tests/femoco/mpi8n2
      - memory issue for openmp?
   - optimize IO (prefetch?)
   - batch algorithm (BatchedGEMV) for patterns 211
   - GPU assembling algorithm via batch?

 * Arbitrary types of transition density matrices (relevant for PT & SOC?),
   which only require the storage of two-index renormalized operators:
   - reference: tdm between separate sci calculations with different no. of electrons
   - nonspin-adapted case: checked by forming 2-RDM using 1-TDM [!!!]
      - <MPS[N]|ap*aq+|MPS'[N]> <=> delta[p,q]<MPS[N]|MPS'[N> - <MPS[N]|aq+*ap|MPS[N']>
      - (0,1) <MPS[N-1]|p|MPS[N]> <=> (1,0)
      - (0,2) <MPS[N-2]|pq|MPS[N]> <=> <MPS[N]|aq+*ap+|MPS[N-2]> (2,0)
      - (1,2) <MPS[N-1]|p+qr|MPS[N]>
      - (2,3) <MPS[N-1]|p+q+tuv|MPS[N]> pattern 212 [communication is required!] 
   - rdm1t (Tpq-1RDM for spin-adapted MPS [without singlet embedding])

 * Benchmark: jiageng or other platform [DONE@2024/XX/XX]
   - Compilation on jiageng: need to used mkl for magma/zquatev, 
                             but use mkl2022 for focus,
                             otherwise, dgemv_batch does not exist!

### 2025 DMRG + QC ###

 * Disentangle transformation:
   - Python implementation
   - Generate circuit for quantum computer

### TODOs: more functionalities ###

 * Kramers version for 2c/4c Hamiltonian: 
   - support complex version [DONE@2023/02/28]
   - what about 'R' operation in contract? [general complex]
   - hvec4 error for CNSz in H5 with real integral? [noise cannot be added, 
      otherwise renormalized state become complex, and the construction of H 
      requires 'Conj' operation in GEMM!] 
   - Two-RDMs: enable Rel-CASSCF with interface to other codes 

### TODOs: better performance ###

 * Decimation for su2 is not parallelized yet

 * Decimation on GPU?
   - cuSolver: svd
   - cuSOlver: eig

 * Point group symmetry (D2h) -> good for molecules like cr2

 * Better Davidson solver on GPU?
   - GPU memory is a problem

 * Real space parallelization (=> More GPU/DCU) [!!!]
   - No really useful for pratical applications except for large-scale benchmark

 * Support Mixed CPU-GPU implementation?
   - mmtasks revise [also avoid copy for magma?]
 
 * Support further partition of operators: reduce GPU memory requirement [!!!]
   - GPU only compute large blocks y[l,r,c1,c2] if d[l] & d[r] > dthresh,
     and hence we only need to send rows of o[l,:] and o[r,:] as well as
     the full vector x & y to GPU, which minimize the memory usage of GPU.
   - Can renorm be performed in a similar way?

### TODOs: applications ###

 * Applications:
    - Small system like C2+/O2? [checked against FCI results]
    - entropy as a complexity measure?
    - Fe2S2 [CAS(30e,20o)] - parallelized
    - SOC within this active space
    - G-tensor/GIAO for Ferric-Ferrous dimer
    - classical help for quantum computing? better biased measurement?
 
 * VMPS+GPU? (simply dense matrix multiplication?)
