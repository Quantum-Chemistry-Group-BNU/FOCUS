### 2025 DMRG[RDM(su2)] ###

 * RDMs for su2 case:
   - su2 dot operators {I,D,M,T,F} [DONE@2024/09/12]
      - oper_dot_su2.h
   - rdm_renorm: support su2 operators {I,D,M} and {B} [DONE@2024/09/13]
      - sadmrg/symbolic_normxwf_su2.h
      - sadmrg/symbolic_formulae_renorm_su2.h
   - check coupling of wf3
   - is_same=true: IMPORTANT [!!!] 
      - rdm1
         - assemble spin-free 1-RDM?
         - direct construction of env matrix
         - using spin recoupling to get spin-orbital 1-RDM?
      - rdm2
         - assemble spin-free 2-RDM?
         - using spin recoupling to get spin-orbital 2-RDM?
   - is_same=false: more patterns to be considered
      - rdm1
      - rdm2
   - rdm1t (Tpq-1RDM for spin-adapted MPS [without singlet embedding])

### 2025 FeMoco[+dynamical correlation/+SOC] ###

 * Convert UHF product state to FOCUS guess? [DONE@2024/XX/XX]
   - This may be operationally useful like BS-DFT.

 * Perturbative noises: is it important?

 * p-DMRG: how to use dets in sampling? is it possible to avoid compression???
   - 设计概率p(Di), importance sampling
   - 避免压缩
   - 同时考虑能量分母
   - 用小体系n2测试?

 * Benchmark: jiageng or other platform [DONE@2024/XX/XX]
   - Compilation on jiageng: need to used mkl for magma/zquatev, 
                             but use mkl2022 for focus,
                             otherwise, dgemv_batch does not exist!
   - fe2s2
   - fe4s4
   - fe8s7
   - femoco: 不同初始化策略，产生不同guess，然后筛选？

### 2025 DMRG + QC ###

 * Disentangle transformation:
   - Combined with LEOs 
   - Python implementation for preparation of MPS [linear combination of CSF]
   - Generate practical circuits for quantum computers [this will be useful for QC-QC community in future!!!]

### TODOs: more functionalities ###

 * Kramers version for 2c/4c Hamiltonian: 
   - support complex version [DONE@2023/02/28]
   - what about 'R' operation in contract? [general complex]
   - hvec4 error for CNSz in H5 with real integral? [noise cannot be added, 
      otherwise renormalized state become complex, and the construction of H 
      requires 'Conj' operation in GEMM!] 
   - Two-RDMs: enable Rel-CASSCF with interface to other codes 

### TODOs: better performance ###

 * Decimation for su2 is not parallelized (using MPI) yet

 * Decimation on GPU?
   - cuSolver: svd
   - cuSOlver: eig

 * Point group symmetry (D2h) -> good for molecules like cr2

 * Better Davidson solver on GPU?
   - GPU memory is a problem

 * Real space parallelization (=> More GPU/DCU) [!!!]
   - No really useful for pratical applications except for large-scale benchmark?

 * Support Mixed CPU-GPU implementation?
   - mmtasks revise [also avoid copy for magma?]
 
 * Support further partition of operators: reduce GPU memory requirement [!!!]
   - GPU only compute large blocks y[l,r,c1,c2] if d[l] & d[r] > dthresh,
     and hence we only need to send rows of o[l,:] and o[r,:] as well as
     the full vector x & y to GPU, which minimize the memory usage of GPU.
   - Can renorm be performed in a similar way?

### TODOs: applications ###

 * Applications:
    - Small system like C2+/O2? [checked against FCI results]
    - entropy as a complexity measure?
    - Fe2S2 [CAS(30e,20o)] - parallelized
    - SOC within this active space
    - G-tensor/GIAO for Ferric-Ferrous dimer
    - classical help for quantum computing? better biased measurement?
 
 * VMPS+GPU? (simply dense matrix multiplication?)
