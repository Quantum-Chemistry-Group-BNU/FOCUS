TODOs:

 1. setup tests for NR & R [DONE20210324]
 
 2. redesign and decouple codes [DONE20210408]
    
 3. implementation of CTNS with TRS [DONE20210516]
    - checked for kinds {rN,rNSz,cN,cNSz,cNK}
    - rewrite qtensor such that qt2/qt3/qt4 are just views

 4. parallelization [DONE2021XXXX]
    1. cleanup (IO) & update tests
    2. preparation: makefile -> mpi 
    3. mpi
    4. hybrid: openmp/gpu?

 5. twordms 

 6. applications:
    1. Small system like C2+/O2? [checked against FCI results]
    2. Fe2S2 [CAS(30e,20o)] - parallelized
    3. SOC within this active space
    4. G-tensor/GIAO for Ferric-Ferrous dimer [GREAT!]

KNOWN PROBLEMs:

 1. thresh_proj & thresh_ortho sensitivity in SCI projection [theoretical/numerical problem?]
