### 2024 DMRG[RDM] ###

 * Reduced density matrices: (RDMs) [DONE@202X/XX/XX]
   - Brute-force RDM & TDM algorithm:
      - non-spin-adapted: [DONE@2024/06/02]
         - Application of local op to MPS:
         - Contract <bMPS|kMPS> to get RDM/TDM
         - quantum information measure:
            - single orbital entropy [or just from 1,2-RDMs]
      - spin-adapted case? 
         - What is the correct math for applying operators?
   - Optimized algorithm via reusing intermediates
      - non-spin-adapted case: [THIS SHOUDLD BE SIMPLE!!!]
         - one-body RDM:
         - two-body RDM:
      - spin-adapted case:
         - one-body RDM:
         - two-body RDM:
      - transition PDM:
         - between same spins
         - between singlet embedding wavefunction?
      - between different spins (for SOC)
         - perturbative SOC via state interaction
   - <MPS|H1e|MPS'> and <MPS|H2e|MPS'>
   - GPU version:
      - using batch algorithm! [GENERATE FORMULAE IS IMPORTANT!!!]
   - Applications:
      - Spin-spin correlation function
      - natural orbitals
      - RDM-based orbital optimization (CASSCF, QIO, ...) 
      - other measures of electron correlation? Shee's work?								

### 2025 DMRG[QC] ###

 * Disentangle transformation:
   - Generate circuit for quantum computer

 * Benchmark: jiageng or other platform [DONE@2024/XX/XX]
   - Compilation on jiageng: need to used mkl for magma/zquatev, 
                             but use mkl2022 for focus,
                             otherwise, dgemv_batch does not exist!
   - fe2s2
   - fe4s4
   - fe8s7
   - femoco

### TODOs: more functionalities ###

 * Kramers version for 2c/4c Hamiltonian: 
   - support complex version [DONE@2023/02/28]
   - what about 'R' operation in contract? [general complex]
   - hvec4 error for CNSz in H5 with real integral? [noise cannot be added, 
      otherwise renormalized state become complex, and the construction of H 
      requires 'Conj' operation in GEMM!] 
   - Two-RDMs: enable Rel-CASSCF with interface to other codes 

### TODOs: better performance ###

 * decim for su2 is not optimized yet

 * Decimation on GPU?
   - cuSolver: svd
   - cuSOlver: eig

 * point group symmetry (D2h) -> good for molecules like cr2

 * Better Davidson solver on GPU?
   - GPU memory is a problem

 * Real space parallelization (=> More GPU/DCU) [!!!]
   - No really useful for pratical applications except for large-scale benchmark

 * Support Mixed CPU-GPU implementation?
   - mmtasks revise [also avoid copy for magma?]
 
 * Support further partition of operators: reduce GPU memory requirement [!!!]
   - GPU only compute large blocks y[l,r,c1,c2] if d[l] & d[r] > dthresh,
     and hence we only need to send rows of o[l,:] and o[r,:] as well as
     the full vector x & y to GPU, which minimize the memory usage of GPU.
   - Can renorm be performed in a similar way?

### TODOs: applications ###

 * Applications:
    - Small system like C2+/O2? [checked against FCI results]
    - entropy as a complexity measure?
    - Fe2S2 [CAS(30e,20o)] - parallelized
    - SOC within this active space
    - G-tensor/GIAO for Ferric-Ferrous dimer
    - classical help for quantum computing? better biased measurement?
 
 * VMPS+GPU? (simply dense matrix multiplication?)
