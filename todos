TODOs:

 1. setup tests for NR & R (DONE20210324)
 
 2. redesign and decouple codes

 3. implementation

 4. parallelization

 5. applications:
    1. Small system like C2+/O2? [checked against FCI results]
    2. Fe2S2 [CAS(30e,20o)] - parallelized
    3. SOC within this active space
    4. G-tensor/GIAO for Ferric-Ferrous dimer [GREAT!]


KNOWN PROBLEMs:

 1. thresh_proj & thresh_ortho sensitivity in SCI projection [theoretical/numerical problem?]
