### FOCUS: FermiOniC qUantum Simulation ###

   Started by Zhendong Li @ Sep 14, 2019

Goals: 
 1. Explore the complexity of electronic structure problems (FeMoco, Mn12, U2, etc.)
 2. Predict magnetic parameters (g-/A-tensors) of transition metal compounds 

Features:
 1. FCI and SCI for benchmarking & preparing initial guesses for TNS
 2. DMRG and CTNS (NR and R with time-reversal symmetry adaptation)

How to install:
 - Requirements:
      1. C++ compiler
      2. BOOST
 - Install:
      1. Edit makefile in extlibs/zquatev/ & make for diagonalizing quaternion matrix
      2. Edit makefile & make
 - Tested compilations:
      1. ICC 19.1.3.304 + boost 1_59_0 (lenovo@BNU)
      2. GCC 9.2.0_2 + boost 1_56_0 (my macbook pro) 

How to run:
 1. run sci.x to generate initial guess
 2. run ctns.x to optimize CTNS, see examples

Known problems:
 1. mpi::reduce hangs on intel MPI

    edit BOOST_MPI_USE_IMPROBE in boost/mpi/config.hpp
