   Started by Zhendong Li @ Sep 14, 2019


Goals: 
 1. Explore the complexity of electronic structure problems (FeMoco, Mn12, U2, etc.)
 2. Predict magnetic parameters (g-/A-tensors) of transition metal compounds 

Requirements:
 1. C++ compiler
 2. BOOST

Functionalities: 
 1. FCI and SCI for benchmarking & preparing initial guess for TNS
 2. DMRG and CTNS with time-reversal symmetry adaptation

Features:
 1. Support NR and R Hamiltonians
 2. Parallelization

How to install:
 1. Edit makefile in extlibs/zquatev/ & make for diagonalizing quaternion matrix
 2. Edit makefile & make
