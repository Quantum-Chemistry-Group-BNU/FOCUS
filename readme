   Started by Zhendong Li @ Sep 14, 2019


Goals:
 1. Explore the complexity of electronic structure problems
 2. Predict magnetic parameters of transition metal compounds

Requirements:
 1. C++ compiler
 2. BOOST

Functionalities: 
 1. FCI and SCI for benchmarking & preparing initial guess for TNS
 2. DMRG and CTNS with time-reversal symmetry adaptation

Features:
 1. Support NR and R Hamiltonians
 2. Parallelization

How to install:
 1. edit makefile in extlibs/zquatev/ & make for diagonalizing quaternion matrix
 2. edit makefile & make
